Choosing a topic I chose my favorite subject, space. I find space and our univerise very interesting and I thought since I have great knowledge with astromany it would be a great topic to cover in my Quiz. 2. Writing the questions I basically thought back on some of the questions that I first learned about space, I was so fasinated by how Light stops time as a whole and how it would take trillions and triollions of years to make it to the edge of our Univeres. So the questions came upon me pretty efferotlesly. 3. Creating my Quiz I learnd the basic code and then repeted over and over, I would make the quiestions and then go on to code the buttons to lead the user to the next question. 4. Challenges In the begining it was hard figuring out how the buttons and the code worked, but after a little bit more effort i found that it was pretty easy. 5. Successes I found sucsees in the basic code and choosing different colored themse was also a success for me. This is my quiz Here]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">tool check</title><link href="https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/11/toolcheck.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="tool check" /><published>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/11/toolcheck</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">HTML Fragments (changing the theme)</title><link href="https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/07/Changing-theme.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="HTML Fragments (changing the theme)" /><published>2022-09-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/07/Changing-theme</id><author><name>Chris Albertson</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the results]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Making a table</title><link href="https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/markdown/2022/09/06/MarkdownPT.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making a table" /><published>2022-09-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/markdown/2022/09/06/MarkdownPT</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week Title What I Learned 00 Tool Setup How to input things on my own and sometimes get an output 01 Intro to Python How to create my owm files and use Python 02 Data Abstraction Learned how to make a Quiz and fixed up my website 03 Creatice Development N/A]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lists &amp;amp; Dictionaries</title><link href="https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/06/L&D.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lists &amp;amp; Dictionaries" /><published>2022-09-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://codeingchris.github.io/The-Grand-Universe/2022/09/06/L&amp;D</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
