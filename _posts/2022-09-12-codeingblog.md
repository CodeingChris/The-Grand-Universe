title: My Space Quiz using Abb labs
---

# Design Process
## 1. Choosing a topic
I chose my favorite subject, space. I find space and our univerise very interesting and I thought since I have great knowledge with astromany it would be a great topic to cover in my Quiz.

## 2. Writing the questions
I basically thought back on some of the questions that I first learned about space, I was so fasinated by how Light stops time as a whole and how it would take trillions and triollions of years to make it to the edge of our Univeres. So the questions came upon me pretty efferotlesly.

## 3. Creating my Quiz
I learnd the basic code and then repeted over and over, I would make the quiestions and then go on to code the buttons to lead the user to the next question.

## 4. Challenges
In the begining it was hard figuring out how the buttons and the code worked, but after a little bit more effort i found that it was pretty easy.

## 5. Successes
I found sucsees in the basic code and choosing different colored themse was also a success for me.
