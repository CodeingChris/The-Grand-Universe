|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The purpose is not a very specific thing and leaves lot of room for misunderstanding|
|Data Abstraction|0|0|The list is named however it is not stated what is being stored in the list|
|Managing Complexity|1|0|All lists are stated clearly and meet the criteria |
|Procedural Abstraction|0|0|The procedure is not explained in relation to the program rather it talks about its use independently. |
|Algorithm Implimentation|1|0|Sequences,selection,iteration are all present and stated in this example. |
|Testing|1|1|The calls are labeled with the output so it is in a place where it can be clearly found and compared. |
