# Test Overview / Refection

I missed 6 questions on this AP Final Exam, a 44/50 (88%). So I feel pretty happy with myself, over this course I have learned a lot, now moving onto next trimester I need to continue to work my way through APCSP!

Q19 : I believe Khalid and I didn't thourly read through this question as well as we should've, the correct answer was C and we answered B

Q20 : With this question we guessed, this one was complex and something we need to learn. The correct answer is D.

Q23 : This one was to hard for me and Khalid to figure out, this one we need to cover again. The correct answer is D.

Q30: This one stumped me, didn't understand the question. The correct answer was B.

Q34: This one we coudl've got right yet I believe we rushed through this question, next time we will take more time. The correct answer was B.

Q38: Again felt rushed through this one, if we spent a little more time on this one we would've gotten it right. The correct answer was B.
